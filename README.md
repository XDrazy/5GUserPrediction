## Background

According to the "World Internet Development Report 2022" released during the World Internet Conference 2022 in Wuzhen, during the first quarter of 2022, the global 5G user base increased by 70 million people, reaching a total of approximately 620 million users, with a 5G population coverage rate exceeding 25%. According to predictions from Ericsson and the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), by the end of 2022, the global number of 5G users is expected to surpass 1 billion.
For telecommunications operators, in the face of such a massive 5G market, leveraging user profiles based on user-side information and further conducting precise marketing to potential 5G users can be extremely beneficial.

## Goal

The task at hand involves utilizing user demographics and communication-related data, such as user call records, data usage, activity patterns, subscription plans, geographical location, and other feature fields. Subsequently, through training data, a model is developed to predict whether each sample in the test dataset belongs to a 5G user or not.
